### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- **enyijiang/enyijiang** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently an intern at Tencent AI Lab, working on Natural Language Processing (NLP). I will continue my MS program at UIUC CS department in August~
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many stuffs. I am still new in this area and lack a lot of experience.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jiangenyi6@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a fanatical music lover and an amateur in piano. I learned classic piano during my childhood. However recently, I loved to play pop music and improvised a little bit of my own style. I also like to do sports during my free time, usually three or four times a week. Besides, I have been traveling a lot with my parents. (I am a foodie, of course!)
