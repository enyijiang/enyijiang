### Hi there 👋

<!-- **enyijiang/enyijiang** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🔭 Before July, I was an intern at Tencent AI Lab, working on Natural Language Processing (NLP). I continue my MS program at UIUC CS department from August~
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many stuffs. I am still new in this area and lack a lot of experience. 
- 📫 How to reach me: jiangenyi6@gmail.com. You can also check more info of me at my personal website [here](https://enyijiang.github.io).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I grow up in a Christian family so I always take the things of God most seriously. Moreover, I am a fanatical music lover and an amateur piano player. I learned classic piano during my childhood. However recently, I loved to play pop music and improvised a little bit of my own style. I also like to do sports during my free time, usually three or four times a week. Besides, I have been traveling a lot with my parents. (I am a foodie, of course!)
